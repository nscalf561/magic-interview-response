Q1: What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. ​In a short paragraph please tell us what you achieved and why it was meaningful to you?

R1: One of my proudest achievements goes back to college when I was lobbying for campaign finance laws.  I joined a group working on getting a bill introduce on the state level tightening up campaign financing restrictions.  Just about everyone knows how impactful the influence of money is in politics (polling has >90% of people saying the influence of money in politics is a major problem).  I ran a team in the Florida Capital, and personally went to the statehouse most days a week to directly lobby with politicians.  We had the bill introduced in the House and Senate for the first time that year (which was subsequently "killed in committee"), and ultimately had a number of local bills passed limiting campaign financing impacts in Tallahassee---just to call it by it's name, decreasing governmental corruption.

In general, I try to make decisions based off the amount of impact I can have.  I love technology because you can have a massively disproportionate impact relative to the work done, and I feel like politics is similar in that regard.  This work was the most impactful thing I could think of doing at the time, and while we didn't have sweeping success, I'm extemely proud of the work and progress that we made for everyone impacted in that community.


Q2: Tell us about something you’ve read recently, why you found it interesting, and why I should read it or check it out. This could be a technical book, online article, github repo,or anything in between.

R2: I know this isn't technically something I read, but between this and the Steve Jobs biography that I just finished, I think this history lecture is much more impactful and digestable.  If you've never watched Steve Blank's lecture entitled "The Secret History of Silicon Valley", it's just about the most valuable hour you can spend working in tech.  Blank digs into the origins of why Silicon Valley is what it is, and the military and governmental impacts that allowed this region to thrive in technology.  I think we should all study history to understand why the world is the way it is, and even as a history fan, Blank touches on a huge amount of things I've never heard of before. https://steveblank.com/secret-history/


Q3: Tell us about one feature of Magic that excites you and why. What might you do with it?

R3: Thinking about what could be done to add value to Magic, I think there is further space to simplify interacting with the web.  So I'm going to use this question to pitch a product that would eliminate the need for cookies on a browser.  For simplicities sake, I'm going to talk about a mobile app (though this could be a chrome extension), and assume that we are disabling stored browser data (private/incognito browser).  This app would have biometric log in to open it (and obviously a Magic link to log in), and then it would have a list of websites that you have accounts for.  Clicking on one of these apps would generate a Magic link, redirect to the site, and handle the log in.  Once you leave the page, the session is killed.  The result of this product would be simplified web browsing (no more typing in urls), no more lingering sessions that are only as secure as your phone or computer are, and no more annoying log ins (the magic of Magic).
